# Omeka S Developer Documentation

Documentation for Omeka S developers.

This repository is the source code for the documentation; the live docs are located
at https://omeka.org/s/docs/developer.

## Contributing
The documentation is built with [MKDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) from the markdown files here. Install mkdocs, then run `mkdocs build` in the directory you clone the files into. A build will be created in the `sites` directory of your clone.

The build from the `sites` directory is excluded via `.gitignore`, but content changes within the `docs` directory will be available.

Corrections and additions via pull requests very much appreciated.
